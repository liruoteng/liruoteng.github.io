I am a PhD student at Electrical & Computer Engineering department, National University of Singapore. My supervisor is [Prof. Cheong Loong Fah]() and [Prof. Robby T. Tan](). I have a very broad research interest in computer vision and machine learning. My current research involves optical flow estimation, bad weather, image restoration and Object Detection & Recognition. 

I am currently a Research Engineer at Yale-NUS, Singapore. 

I was a visiting student in Cambridge Image Analysis (CIA) group led by [Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb]() at the Department Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP), Cambridge University.
